## Hakanai blog starter kit

This repository contains various resources for bloggers and content creators to help them get started with their blog.

You may want to contribute to this repository by suggesting new resources or improvements to existing ones.

To do so, either create a new issue or submit a pull request with your changes.

This repository is however not intended to list all software tools or resources available for bloggers. 
Instead, it focuses on a curated list of resources that are most relevant to bloggers and content creators. 

Some suggestions may be refused if:
- They are not relevant to bloggers
- They do not meet quality standards (e.g., outdated, poorly maintained)
- They have limited functionality compared to other similar resources
- They lack proper documentation
- They are too niche or specialized for general blogging needs (an e-commerce platform, for example, event if it has a blog feature)
- They have known security or privacy concerns
